# Satellite Crop Type Mapping
  
This repository contains the source code for the Satellite Crop Type Mapping Learning Module, which guides a user through the steps to combine satellite imagery, weather data, and survey data in a machine learning model to estimate where crops are growing over an area. The process demonstrated is based on a modeling process refined by a team at Atlas AI in [Understanding the Requirements for Surveys to Support Satellite-Based Crop Type Mapping: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa](https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-9609). The contents of the repo are as follows:  
  
* Satellite Crop Mapping.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full Satellite Crop Mapping tutorial with all associated code
* Satellite Crop Mapping.html: Webpage version of the tutorial
* Satellite Crop Mapping Appendix.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing script to create sample survey dataset to use in tutorial demonstration
* Satellite Crop Mappint Appendix.html: Webpage version of the appendix
* sample_survey_fields_geo.geojson: sample survey data to use for demonstration purposes in Satellite Crop Mapping.ipynb; created from Satellite Crop Mapping Appendix.ipynb
